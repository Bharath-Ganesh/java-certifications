/*
A var is used as a local variable in a constructor, method, or initializer block.
A var cannot be used in constructor parameters, method parameters, instance variables, or class variables.
A var is always initialized on the same line (or statement) where it is declared.
The value of a var can change, but the type cannot.
A var cannot be initialized with a null value without a type.
A var is not permitted in a multiple-variable declaration.
A var is a reserved type name but not a reserved word, meaning it can be used as an identifier except as a class, interface, or enum name.

Summary

1.  Use 'f' or 'F' to indicate float values. (ex)
2.  Binary, Octal, Decimal and Hex values.
3.  Arithmetic operators.
4.  Resulting type of operations on type smaller than 'int' is an 'int', including 'char' type. 
5.  Type casting (ex)
6.  The result of arithmetic operation will be the type of the largest participant.
7.  Bitwise complement operator inverts all bits of a number. 
8.  -a = ~a+1, inverting all bits and adding one.
9.  Bitwise operator:
        1. Signed left shift     : Shifts each bit to the left, fills low order with 0.
        2. Signed right shift    : Shifts each bit to the right, fills low order with the head bit value.
        3. Unsigned right shift  : Shifts each bit to the right, but fills low order with 0.
10.  Short circuit evaluation.
        Whether the left hand of expression is true, the right side still has to be evaluated. (ex)
11.  Switch expressions must be used with (byte,short, int, char, string, and enum.)
